# Patient Serial Number Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of unique patient serial numbers in the NeuroVision application.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Model
- Removed the `unique: true` constraint from the email field in the User schema
- Kept the `unique: true` constraint on the `patientInfo.serial` field
- Added code to automatically remove any existing email index

### 2. Serial Number Generation
- Implemented the `generatePatientSerial()` function in `authController.js`
- The function creates serials in the format `PAT-YYYYMMDD-XXXX` where:
  - YYYYMMDD is the current date
  - XXXX is a random 4-character hexadecimal string
- This ensures each patient gets a unique identifier even if multiple accounts use the same email

### 3. Frontend Display
- Added patient serial number display in the dashboard profile card
- Added custom styling to make the serial number visually distinctive
- Added a column in the Admin Dashboard to display patient serial numbers
- Enhanced user data fetching to ensure the complete user profile is available

## Testing
- Created test scripts to verify:
  - Multiple users can share the same email
  - Unique patient serial numbers are generated for each patient
  - Serial numbers are correctly displayed in the UI

## Future Enhancements
- Add a search feature in the admin dashboard to find patients by serial number
- Include the serial number in exported reports
- Allow patients to use their serial number as an alternative login method
